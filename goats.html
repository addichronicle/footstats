            <li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Lionel Messi</li> <br>
            <img src="images/messi.jpg" alt=""> <br>
            <p>
                The history books will laud Messi, and yet their limitations will do him a disservice. In 20 years,
                young football fans will read about a messianic figure whose brilliance stunned the world, shattered a
                litany of records and started an era of dominance… but not until they watch the videos will they get an
                idea of what they have missed.

                The quantity of his goals pale in comparison with their beauty. The goal of the month may not even make
                his top 20, be it a solo run, a bending free-kick, a cheeky lob, a golf putt finish or a thunderous
                missile.


            </p>
            <p>
                TBy now most know his story: how expensive medicine for a growth hormone deficiency led him from his
                home town Rosario to Barcelona, where his 2004 debut started an era of brilliance. He has been voted
                into the world's top three players for 10 years, and in the top two for nine.

                It’s one thing to reach the top, quite another to stay there. There are fans well into their 20s who
                have never known a world in which Messi is not spellbinding us on a weekly basis.

                Only by evolution has Messi managed to maintain his level. The livewire dribbler has become a mature
                playmaker who now dictates play while still proving decisive in the final third. Never has Messi, now in
                his 30s, better balanced playmaking, dribbling and goalscoring.

                As Javier Mascherano has said, he is three players in one. You could argue that one of the greatest
                goalscorers of all time is also the best passer, and you would not lack evidence to support your claim.

                In the meantime, pundits, fans and writers will try to express his greatness with words and metaphors.
                They will all fail, as will the article you are reading now. The best we can do is listen to Pep
                Guardiola, who said: “Don’t write about him, don’t try to describe him. Just watch him.”
            </p>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Diego Maradona</li> <br>
<img src="images/maradona.webp" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    How do you separate the three greatest footballers of all time? Any of them would have been worthy winners, but we
    can only pick one.

    Longevity, goals and trophies are where Lionel Messi and Pele arguably have the slight edge but, boy, Maradona was
    exciting. The Argentine was the rebel who produced possibly the most iconic individual goal ever scored, on the way
    to maybe the greatest World Cup triumph of all in 1986. A man who’s been deified in both his homeland and the
    Italian city of Naples.

    Just 5ft 5in tall, El Pibe de Oro’s dribbling skills enthralled a generation, from the moment he made his Argentinos
    Juniors debut as a 15-year-old, and nutmegged an opponent with his first touch. He scored 116 goals in 166 games
    then joined Boca, winning the league title after a solo goal against rivals River Plate.

<p>
    Barcelona paid £5m a year later - within months, he’d taken Real Madrid apart at the Bernabeu, before injury and
    illness struck him down. He moved to Napoli for £6.9m in 1984, the first player transferred for a world record fee
    on two separate occasions. There came his finest days - inspiring his new club to the only two league titles of
    their history, after World Cup glory in Mexico. He captained Argentina to another final in 1990.

    Yes, he never won the European Cup, or progressed beyond even the last 16, but Maradona was about so much more than
    mere trophies.
</p>
<p>
    Career highlight: Dominating the 1986 World Cup with five goals and five assists, scoring the Goal of the Century
    against England. The one he scored with his foot…
</p> <br>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Pele</li> <br>
<img src="images/pele.webp" alt="Pele With The Three World Cups That He Won"> <br>
<p>
    At the age of 17, in 1958, Pele became the youngest player to feature in a World Cup final. He scored six
    times
    in Sweden, including a semi-final hat-trick and two more in the final. It was to be the first of three World
    Cup
    trophies he brought back home as an answer to those tears he saw running down his dad’s face.

    His contribution in 1962 was minimised by injury, while the persistent fouling of him in 1966 made him swear
    that it would be his last World Cup. He didn’t stick to it. He was convinced into returning for a fourth
    tournament in 1970 and became part of one of the best attacks ever compiled – alongside Tostao, Jairzinho,
    Rivellino, Clodoaldo and Gerson. While Jairzinho top-scored, Pele added four more to his World Cup tally.

    In the 1960s and '70s, Pele travelled the world with his club team Santos. In Nigeria, a two-day truce was
    declared in the war with Biafra as a way for both sides to watch him play. His impact on the Nigerian
    football
    psyche is so huge that when he predicted an African nation would win the World Cup before the noughties,
    local
    fans already saw it coming.

<p>“In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the
    ground he walked on,” said his former team-mate Clodoaldo.

    The Brazilian played his last game for Santos in 1974 and postponed his retirement plans to sign for the New
    York Cosmos. He was in debt and desperate to recover his finances, so chose to move to the North American
    Soccer
    League. After leading the Cosmos to the NASL title in 1977, he played his farewell game on a rainy New York
    day.
    But how many days he'd brightened before that.
</p>

<p>
    Career highlight: On November 19, 1969, Pele scored his 1,000th goal from a penalty in a match against Vasco
    da
    Gama at the Maracana stadium.
</p> <br>

</p>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Johann Cruyff</li> <br>
<img src="images/cruyff.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    Two months after making his first-team debut, Cruyff met former PE teacher Rinus Michels. Together, the pair
    invented Total Football. Wingers and overlapping full-backs kept the pitch wide, defenders were encouraged
    to
    bring the ball out from the back (if a midfielder dropped to cover the space) and the centre-forward –
    usually
    Cruyff – could roam free as Michels’ on-field conductor.

    It worked. Cruyff won 20 major honours – including three successive European Cups from 1971 to 1973 – before
    a
    player revolt had him banished to Barcelona. Not content with revolutionising one club, El Salvador (the
    saviour) did so again, winning the Catalans’ first Liga title for 14 years. Nobody could match his speed,
    vision
    or eye for goal.

    Part of arguably the best team never to win the World Cup in 1974 – the Netherlands lost 2-1 to West Germany
    in
    the final, having gone 1-0 up without the hosts touching the ball – Cruyff may not have reached his peak
    with
    his national team, but that only adds to his allure.

    He retired in 1978, aged 31, and refused to go that summer’s World Cup. The following year, however, he was
    back, having lost the vast majority of his fortune in a pig farm venture in Catalonia. Spells in America for
    the
    Los Angeles Aztecs and Washington Diplomats followed, as did a trophy-laden return to Ajax and even a season
    at
    their bitter rivals Feyenoord.

    “Cruyff always seemed to be in control. He made things happen,” said Rudi van Dantzig, a long-time
    collaborator
    of the great ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, himself a close friend of Cruyff’s. “There was something very
    dramatic about him, like a Greek drama – life or death, almost, even when they played ordinary Dutch League
    games.”

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Michel Platini</li> <br>
<img src="images/platini.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    French midfielder, Platini, has three Ballon d'Ors to his name, and they all came in successive years from 1983
    to 1985 which goes a long way to show his recognition in the global game. he is the only player with this many
    Ballons d'Or to not be a forward, although his goalscoring exploits were as effective as clinical talisman.

    Among his long list of accolades, his 1984 Euro campaign was very impressive, as he was named player of the
    tournament and also managed to be the top scorer despite being a midfielder. The former UEFA President scored
    over 200 times in his club career for Nancy, Saint-Etienne and Juventus.

<p>
    One of the most elegant midfielders in history, Michel Platini was deadly in front of goal, and possessed the
    mentality of a winner. That enabled him to excel everywhere he went, and to produce what was arguably the
    greatest-ever individual performance at an international tournament when he led France to Euro 84 triumph on
    home soil with nine goals in five matches.

    Platini’s best games were saved for his national team, however, with whom he fronted of one of the best midfield
    trios ever alongside Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana. They came close at the 1982 World Cup, before dramatically
    losing to West Germany on penalties in the semi-final. Two years later, Platini was absolutely unstoppable
    during the Euros, scoring two hat-tricks against Belgium and Yugoslavia in the group stage, and eventually
    deciding the final against Spain with a free-kick.

    Platini was the brightest star in the world back then, winning three Ballons d'Or consecutively in 1983, 1984
    and 1985. Football lovers cried with him when France lost in the World Cup semi-finals again in 1986. A year
    later, he retired at the age of 32. It seemed a premature, cruel decision to the millions who got joy from
    watching him play.

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Franz Beckenbaeur</li> <br>
<img src="images/beckenbauer.jpg" alt=""> <br>

<p>
    Like many great players, Beckenbauer was adept at playing in several positions. Originally a centre-forward, he
    actually made his Bayern debut in the Regionalliga Sud as a left winger, and in his first full season, Bayern
    won promotion to the recently formed Bundesliga. As Bayern’s youth team products blossomed, Bayern gradually
    became the dominant force in West German football.

    There are two versions of the story about how Beckenbauer was given the 'Kaiser' moniker. Beckenbauer claims it
    was because, in 1968, he posed alongside a bust of former Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph, and the media referred
    to him as Fussball Kaiser afterwards. Alternatively, it was because in the 1969 German Cup Final he fouled
    Schalke’s Reinhard Libuda, often known as Konig von Westfalen (King of Westphalia), and the press believed that
    Beckenbauer had now trumped him.
</p> <br>

    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
<p>
    Either way, the exalted moniker was entirely befitting: Bayern won a hat-trick of Bundesliga titles between 1972
    and 1974, and did likewise in the European Cup between 1974 and 1976. On the international stage, Beckenbauer
    captained West Germany to triumph in the 1972 European Championship and 1974 World Cup.

    Like Bayern, Beckenbauer wasn’t universally loved, and often expressed shock at the aggression displayed towards
    his team at Bundesliga away games. Aged 18, he was banned from the West German youth team for refusing to marry
    his pregnant girlfriend, and – controversially - he was no longer selected for international matches after
    joining the New York Cosmos in 1977 for a hugely successful four-year spell.

    Der Kaiser returned to the Bundesliga in the early 1980s, when he led Hamburg to the league title. Naturally. He
    was a born winner.
</p>
<p>
    Career highlight: At Hampden Park in 1976, Beckenbauer captained Bayern on the night they completed a hat-trick
    of European Cup victories, defeating Saint-Etienne. “I still have a huge feeling of pride about that one,” he
    later recalled.
</p> <br>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Paolo Maldini</li> <br>
<img src="images/maldini.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    Like Baresi, Maldini was a one-club man and was a stalwart of the AC Milan team for 25 years, which is an
    incredible feat for any player. He managed to achieve this longevity in the game by adapting his game to be
    world-class at both left-back and centre-back, mastering his trade in two separate roles. The art of defending
    was made to look effortless and almost easy by the Italian on the way to winning five European Cups and seven
    Serie A titles.

    The most dominant spell AC Milan enjoyed during Maldini's career was under Carlo Ancelotti in the early 2000s,
    as the Italian club returned to being a European powerhouse. This was in large part due to the leadership
    qualities of Maldini, going along with his incredible defensive IQ.
</p> <br>

<p>
    “Paolo’s biological age is much younger than his actual age. The tests we have done now have scored much higher
    than three of four years ago,” said Adriano Galliani of the then-36-year-old in 2005.

    Very few players reach the vaunted 1,000-game mark. Even fewer do so as a mainstay at one of European football’s
    gilded heavyweights. Maldini did both, winning seven league championships and a frankly staggering five European
    Cup/Champions League titles in the process. All the while he embodied the Milanese notion of grinta – ‘grit’ –
    but without sacrificing more typically Italian qualities of suave, refinement and immeasurable handsomeness.

    His only relative disappointments came with Italy, who finished runners-up at the 1994 World Cup and at Euro
    2000 (although his own displays were impeccable in both tournaments). If his retirement in 2009, at the age of
    40, was proof of the inevitable effects of time, then the previous 25 years were equally good evidence for the
    very opposite: a player for whom age only served to sharpen his exquisite talents.
</p>
<p>
    Career highlight: Helping Milan go unbeaten to win Serie A in 1991/92.
</p> <br>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Ruud Gullit</li> <br>
<img src="images/gullit.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<p>The former AC Milan midfielder makes it into the top 25 and ranks among some of the top players to have
    played the game in his
    position. Gullit spent the best years of his career in Italy where he went on to win three Serie A titles
    and two European Cups.
    He was even able to reinvent himself as a top-class centre-back in the latter stages of his career when he
    signed for Chelsea.
</p>

<p> From 1979 up to his retirement, Gullit played for a total of six clubs, scoring a total of 219 goals and
    providing 100 assists
    during that time frame. While he was born in Suriname, he opted to represent the Netherlands and played for
    two of the biggest clubs in the Eredivisie in Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven.
</p>
<p>While the mighty Dutchman might be best known for his unmatched hairstyle and moustache, there is no doubting
    Gullit's ability
    on the pitch. What a talent he was.</p> <br>

<p>
    A footballer of impossible elegance, Gullit’s actual position was hard to define. At Feyenoord, he began as a
    sweeper before moving into a midfield playmaking role. At Milan, he played on the right of a front three and in
    the hole. Even before he became European champion for club and country, he won the Ballon d’Or in 1987.

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Ronaldinho Gaucho</li> <br>
<img src="images/ronaldinho.webp" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    His buck-tooth smile made him one of the most recognisable faces in football. Ronaldinho was a rare case of a
    man who could make the unpredictable seem commonplace on the field. He was twice voted FIFA World Player of the
    Year, and was indeed the best player on the planet in the mid-2000s.
</p> <br>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZTqEUFtNqA?si=1LiSfRUD5W0tS64n"

    allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>
<p>
    If greatness was measured in joy, Ronaldinho would leave the others by some distance during his five seasons at
    Barcelona, which delivered two league titles and a Champions League crown. He would later emulate his best days
    at Atletico Mineiro in their victorious Copa Libertadores campaign.
</p>
<p>
    Career highlight: Winning the 2002 World Cup as part a formidable trio with Ronaldo and Rivaldo dubbed by
    Brazilian commentator Galvao Bueno as ‘the three Rs’.
</p> <br>

<li style="color: rgb(243, 13, 13); font-size: x-large;">Cristiano Ronaldo</li> <br>
<img src="images/roro.webp" alt=""> <br>
<p>
    When Ronaldo became the first player ever to score in five World Cups, two days after Argentina opened their
    2022 campaign with a shock defeat to Saudi Arabia, he hoped it would be the start of his bid to stand above
    Lionel Messi forever. Instead, things unravelled irreparably in just a few weeks.

    While Messi went on to win the World Cup, Ronaldo found himself dropped by Portugal, eliminated by Morocco, then
    seemingly unwanted by Europe’s top clubs after not so much burning his bridges at Manchester United, as blowing
    them to pieces with a barrage of Piers Morgan-loaded HIMARS missiles.

    “It’s not the end of my career to come to South Africa,” CR7 insisted upon his arrival at, er, Saudi Arabian
    side Al Nassr, with a classic Robinho gaffe that probably gave away he wasn’t entirely thrilled to be at his new
    club, with average gates of just 8,000 last season. “In Europe, my work is done,” he continued, flexing as a
    self-defence mechanism. It was hard to escape the suspicion that Europe had decided it was done with him, rather
    than the other way around.

    All careers come to a close eventually, and not all of them have the perfect ending - Zinedine Zidane literally
    bowed out with a red card; Diego Maradona had drugs bans in his final years. At 37, Ronaldo has done an
    extraordinary job of holding back the ageing process, scoring 66 goals for Portugal after his 30th birthday to
    set a new international goalscoring record, and taking his Champions League tally to a record 140.

    Recent months have seen a man whose mobility no longer matched his monumental motivation, frustrated that things
    weren’t what they used to be, and never could be again. When you’ve been so great for so long, letting go of the
    dream of recapturing old glories was never going to be easy.

    This is a player who’s won both the Ballon d’Or and the Champions League five times, captained Portugal to their
    only international trophy, won four European Golden Shoes and become Real Madrid’s record scorer, netting at
    least 50 goals in six successive seasons - not even Messi did that at Barcelona.

    Right now, it’s hard not to view Ronaldo through the prism of Qatar - that long tearful walk back to the
    dressing room, while his greatest rival lifted the trophy and secured supremacy forevermore.

    But for more than half of his life, Ronaldo has been a superstar, one of the very finest footballers of all
    time. No player has ever spent so long at the top.
</p>
<p>
    Career highlight: In 2008, a towering Ronaldo header helped Manchester United to the Champions League title,
    leading him to his life-long goal of being voted the best player in the world. He had reached the pinnacle at 23
    - and yet it was just the start.
